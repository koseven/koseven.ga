# Requirements

[!!] Before continuing, make sure you have a web server (like Apache) configured with the following requirements.

 - PHP 7.0.21 or newer.
 - [PHP Short open tag Enabled](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag)
 - [Iconv Extension](http://php.net/iconv)
 - [Character Type (CTYPE) Extension](http://php.net/ctype)
 - [PCRE Extension](http://php.net/pcre)
 - [SPL Enabled](http://php.net/spl)
 - [Reflections Enabled](http://php.net/reflection)
 - [Filters Enabled](http://php.net/filter)

# Download

You can get the latest **stable** release on the [Koseven website](https://koseven.ga/). This will give you a fully functional application with an `application`, `modules`, and `system` directory.

[!!] You can find information about the file structure on the [Cascading Filesystem](/documentation/system/files) page.

Once downloaded, you should extract the Kohana application to a directory where the web server can access it. Going forward, we are going to assume you've extracted the application to a `kohana` directory such that `http://localhost/kohana/index.php` is pointing to the `index.php` file in the Kohana release.

# Configure

Before the application can be run, you will need to make a few changes to the `application/bootstrap.php` file. This file is the first one to be included by `index.php` and sets up most of the global options for the application. Open `application/bootstrap.php` and make the following changes:

 - Set the default [timezone](http://php.net/timezones) for your application.
~~~
// Example of changing timezone to Sao Paulo, Brazil
date_default_timezone_set('America/Sao_Paulo');
~~~
 - Set the `base_url` in the [Kohana::init] call to reflect the location of the kohana folder on your server relative to the document root.
~~~
/**
 * Example of kohana's installation at /var/www/kohana and
 * Apache's DocumentRoot configured to /var/www
 */
Kohana::init(array(
	'base_url' => '/',
));
~~~

 - List your trusted hosts. Open `application/config/url.php` and add regex patterns of the hosts you expect your application to be accessible from.

   [!!] Do not forget to escape your dots (.) as these are regex patterns. These patterns should always fully match, as they are prepended with `^` and appended with `$`.
~~~
return array(
	'trusted_hosts' => array(
		'example\.org',
		'.*\.example\.org',
	),
);
~~~

 - Define a salt for the `Cookie` class.
~~~
Cookie::$salt = 'some-really-long-cookie-salt-here';
~~~

 - Make sure the `application/cache` and `application/logs` directories are writable by the web server.
~~~
sudo chmod -R a+rwx application/cache
sudo chmod -R a+rwx application/logs
~~~

[!!] Make sure to use a unique salt for your application and never to share it. Take a look at the [Cookies](/documentation/system/cookies) page for more information on how cookies work in Kohana. If you do not define a `Cookie::$salt` value, Kohana will throw an exception when it encounters any cookie on your domain.

 - Test your installation by opening [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

You should see the installation page. If it reports any errors, you will need to correct them before continuing.

Once your install page reports that your environment is set up correctly you need to either rename or delete `install.php`. Kohana is now installed and you should see the output of the welcome controller:

## Installing Kohana From GitHub

The [source code](https://github.com/koseven/koseven) for Kohana is hosted with [GitHub](http://github.com). To install Kohana using the github source code first you need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/). Visit [http://help.github.com](http://help.github.com) for details on how to install git on your platform.

Use the following command to install Kohana from GitHub:
~~~
git clone git@github.com:koseven/koseven.git .
